# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **What is P2P?**.

## What is P2P then?

*Peer-to-peer* (P2P) refers to a *decentralized communication model* in which two or more parties can communicate and exchange data directly with each other without the need for a central server or authority. In a P2P network, each party (also known as a *“peer”*) acts as both a *client* and a *server*, allowing them to communicate and share resources *directly with each other*.

Get started by **[creating a new site](https://p2p.arvrtise.link)**.

# What are some examples we know as consumers for applications built over p2p networks?

- blockchain (e.g. bitcoin)
- stuff like popcorn time or strem.io that use bittorrent

We don’t yet have true p2p social commonly used and hopefully by the time you end this short essay you will think as I do that it’s really important that we do. So here we are, to create a community.
