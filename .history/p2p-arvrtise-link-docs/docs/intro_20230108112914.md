# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **What is P2P?**.

## What is P2P then?

Peer-to-peer (P2P) refers to a decentralized communication model in which two or more parties can communicate and exchange data directly with each other without the need for a central server or authority. In a P2P network, each party (also known as a “peer”) acts as both a client and a server, allowing them to communicate and share resources directly with each other.
